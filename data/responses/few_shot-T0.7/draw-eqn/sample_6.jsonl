Using the formula above, we can set up the equation:\n\n12 / (20 + x) = 6 / (20 - x)\n\nTo solve this equation, we can cross multiply:\n\n12(20 - x) = 6(20 + x)\n\n240 - 12x = 120 + 6x\n\nCollecting like terms:\n\n18x = 120\n\nx = 120 / 18\n\nx = 6.67\n\nTherefore, the speed of the river is approximately 6.67 km/h.\n\nThe answer is 6.67."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 853, "completion_tokens": 2899, "total_tokens": 3752}, "question": "Question: One number is 4 more than three times a smaller number .

Let's say the cost per kilo of oranges is 'x' and the cost per kilo of apples is 'y'. \n\nFrom the given information, we can create two equations:\n\n6x + 5y = 419   (equation 1)\n5x + 7y = 488   (equation 2)\n\nTo solve these equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the method of substitution.\n\nFrom equation 1, we can isolate 'x':\n\n6x = 419 - 5y\nx = (419 - 5y)/6\n\nNow, substitute this value of 'x' into equation 2:\n\n5((419 - 5y)/6) + 7y = 488\n\nSimplify:\n\n(5/6)(419 - 5y) + 7y = 488\n(5/6)(419) - (5/6)(5y) + 7y = 488\n(5/6)(419) + (7 - 25/6)y = 488\n(5/6)(419) + (42/6 - 25/6)y = 488\n(5/6)(419) + (17/6)y = 488\n\nMultiply through by 6 to eliminate fractions:\n\n5(419) + 17y = 2928\n2095 + 17y = 2928\n17y = 2928 - 2095\n17y = 833\ny = 833/17\ny \u2248 48.9\n\nNow, substitute this value of 'y' back into equation 1 to find 'x':\n\n6x + 5(48.9) = 419\n6x + 244.5 = 419\n6x = 419 - 244.5\n6x = 174.5\nx = 174.5/6\nx \u2248 29.1\n\nTherefore, the cost per kilo of oranges is approximately $29.10 and the cost per kilo of apples is approximately $48.90.\n\nThe answer is [29.1, 48.9]."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}, {"index": 14, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Equation: {6*x + 5*y = 419, 5*x + 7*y = 488}\nThe answer is {67.0, 54.0}"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}, {"index": 15, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "The cost of oranges per kilo is 53 and the cost of apples per kilo is 64.

We know that Jenna is 5 years older than Darius, so we can write the equation x = y + 5. We also know that the sum of their ages is 21 years, so we can write the equation x + y = 21. \n\nNow we can solve this system of equations. Substituting x = y + 5 into the second equation, we get (y + 5) + y = 21. Simplifying this equation, we get 2y + 5 = 21. Subtracting 5 from both sides, we get 2y = 16. Dividing both sides by 2, we get y = 8. \n\nNow we can substitute the value of y into the equation x = y + 5 to find Jenna's age.

The effective speed with the current is (b + c), so we have the equation:\n350 = (b + c) * 7\n\nNow we can solve these two equations to find the values of \"b\" and \"c\". \n\nMultiplying the first equation by 7 and the second equation by 10, we get:\n3000 = 10b - 10c\n3500 = 7b + 7c\n\nAdding these two equations together, we eliminate the \"c\" term:\n6500 = 17b\n\nDividing both sides by 17, we get:\nb = 382.35\n\nSubstituting this value of \"b\" back into the first equation, we can solve for \"c\":\n300 = (382.35 - c) * 10\n300 = 3823.5 - 10c\n10c = 3523.5\nc = 352.35\n\nTherefore, the speed of the boat is approximately 382.35 feet per minute and the speed of the current is approximately 352.35 feet per minute.\n\nThe answer is [382.35, 352.35]."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}, {"index": 10, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula: distance = rate x time.\n\nLet's assume the rate of the man's rowing is r, and the rate of the current is c.\n\nWhen rowing upstream, the effective rate is reduced by the current, so the equation becomes: 300 = (r - c) x 10\n\nWhen rowing downstream, the effective rate is increased by the current, so the equation becomes: 350 = (r + c) x 7\n\nNow we have a system of equations to solve:\n\n300 = 10r - 10c\n350 = 7r + 7c\n\nWe can solve this system of equations by elimination or substitution.\n\nLet's use substitution to solve for r:\n\nFrom the first equation, we can solve for r in terms of c:\nr = (300 + 10c) / 10\n\nSubstituting this into the second equation, we get:\n350 = 7((300 + 10c) / 10) + 7c\n\nSimplifying:\n350 = (2100 + 70c) / 10 + 7c\n350 = 210 + 7c + 7c\n350 - 210 = 14c\n140 = 14c\nc = 10\n\nSubstituting this back into the first equation, we can solve for r:\n300 = 10r - 10(10)\n300 = 10r - 100\n400 = 10r\nr = 40\n\nTherefore, the rate of the man's rowing is 40 feet per minute, and the rate of the current is 10 feet per minute.\n\nThe answer is [40, 10]"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}, {"index": 11, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula distance = rate x time.

Let's say x represents the number of 10 oz. cups, y represents the number of 14 oz. cups, and z represents the number of 20 oz. cups.\n\nWe can set up the following equations:\nx + y + z = 24 (equation 1) (since Kyle served a total of 24 cups)\n10x + 14y + 20z = 384 (equation 2) (since Kyle used a total of 384 ounces of coffee)\n0.95x + 1.15y + 1.50z = 30.60 (equation 3) (since Kyle collected a total of $30.60)\n\nTo solve this system of equations, we can use substitution or elimination method. Let's use substitution method.\n\nFrom equation 1, we can rewrite it as:\nx = 24 - y - z (equation 4)\n\nSubstitute equation 4 into equations 2 and 3:\n10(24 - y - z) + 14y + 20z = 384\n0.95(24 - y - z) + 1.15y + 1.50z = 30.60\n\nSimplify the equations:\n240 - 10y - 10z + 14y + 20z = 384\n22.8 - 0.95y - 0.95z + 1.15y + 1.50z = 30.60\n\nCombine like terms:\n-10y + 14y - 10z + 20z = 384 - 240\n0.20y + 0.55z = 7.80\n\nMultiply equation 5 by 100 to eliminate decimals:\n20y + 55z = 780 (equation 5)\n\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n0.20y + 0.55z = 7.80 (equation 6)\n20y + 55z = 780 (equation 7)\n\nMultiply equation 6 by 100 to eliminate decimals:\n20y + 55z = 780 (equation 8)\n\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n20y + 55z = 780 (equation 7)\n20y + 55z = 780 (equation 8)\n\nSince equation 7 and equation 8 are the same, this means that any value of y and z that satisfies equation 7 will also satisfy equation 8.\n\nWe can choose any value for y or z and solve for the other variable. Let's choose y = 0.\n\nSubstitute y = 0 into equation 7:\n20(0) + 55z = 780\n55z = 780\nz = 780/55\nz = 14.18 (approximately)\n\nSo, if y = 0, then z = 14.18 (approximately).\n\nSubstitute y = 0 and z = 14.18 (approximately) into equation 4:\nx = 24 - 0 - 14.18\nx = 9.82 (approximately)\n\nSo, if y = 0 and z = 14.18 (approximately), then x = 9.82 (approximately).\n\nTherefore, Kyle filled approximately 9.82 cups of 10 oz., 0 cups of 14 oz., and 14.18 cups of 20 oz.\n\nThe answer is approximately {9.82, 0, 14.18}."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}, {"index": 19, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's assume Kyle filled x cups of 10 oz, y cups of 14 oz, and z cups of 20 oz.\n\nFrom the given information, we can set up the following equations:\n1. x + y + z = 24 (total number of cups)\n2. 10x + 14y + 20z = 384 (total ounces of coffee)\n3. 0.95x + 1.15y + 1.50z = 30.60 (total cost)\n\nWe can solve these equations to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nUsing a calculator or solving the equations manually, we get x = 10, y = 10, and z = 4.\n\nTherefore, Kyle filled 10 cups of 10 oz, 10 cups of 14 oz, and 4 cups of 20 oz.\n\nThe answer is [10, 10, 4]."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 855, "completion_tokens": 7201, "total_tokens": 8056}, "question": "Question: Leanna has $ 37 to spend in a record store .

Let's denote the rate at which the first car is driven as r1 and the rate at which the second car is driven as r2. \n\nWhen the cars are driven toward each other, the combined rate is r1 + r2. The time is 48 minutes, which is equal to 48/60 = 0.8 hours. So the distance is (r1 + r2) * 0.8.\n\nWhen the cars are driven in the same direction, the effective rate is the difference between their rates, which is r1 - r2. The time is 240 minutes, which is equal to 240/60 = 4 hours. So the distance is (r1 - r2) * 4.\n\nWe know that the total distance between the cars is 140 km.

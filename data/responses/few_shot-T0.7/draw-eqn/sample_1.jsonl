Since Lily travels 10 miles per hour faster than Noe, her speed would be x + 10 miles per hour. \nWe know that the distance traveled is equal to the speed multiplied by the time. In this case, both Noe and Lily travel for 4 hours. \nSo, the distance traveled by Noe would be 4x, and the distance traveled by Lily would be 4(x + 10). \nSince they are traveling in opposite directions, the sum of their distances would be equal to 480 miles. \nTherefore, we can set up the equation: 4x + 4(x + 10) = 480. \nSimplifying the equation, we get: 4x + 4x + 40 = 480. \nCombining like terms, we get: 8x + 40 = 480. \nSubtracting 40 from both sides, we get: 8x = 440. \nDividing both sides by 8, we get: x = 55. \nSo, Noe's speed is 55 miles per hour, and Lily's speed is 55 + 10 = 65 miles per hour. \nTherefore, the average rate of speed for Noe is 55 miles per hour, and the average rate of speed for Lily is 65 miles per hour. \nThe answer is [55, 65]."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}, {"index": 18, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let the rate of speed for Noe be x miles per hour.

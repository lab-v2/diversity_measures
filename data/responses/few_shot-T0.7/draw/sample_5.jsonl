We can solve this system using substitution or elimination method.\n\nLet's solve it using substitution method:\nFrom the second equation, we can express x in terms of y: x = 3y - 1.\nSubstitute this expression for x in the first equation: (3y - 1) + y = -17.\nSimplify the equation: 4y - 1 = -17.\nAdd 1 to both sides: 4y = -16.\nDivide both sides by 4: y = -4.\n\nNow substitute this value of y back into either equation to find x:\nx = 3(-4) - 1 = -12 - 1 = -13.\n\nTherefore, the two numbers are -13 and -4.\nThe answer is [-13, -4]."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}, {"index": 10, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve this problem, let's assign variables to the unknown numbers.

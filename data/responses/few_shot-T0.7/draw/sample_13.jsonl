Since time = distance / speed, we have:\n\n60 = 100 / (P + W)\n\nOn the return trip, with a headwind, the effective speed of the plane is P - W mph. The distance traveled is again 100 miles, but the time taken is 40 minutes more than the first trip. So:\n\n60 + 40 = 100 / (P - W)\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two variables. Simplifying the equations:\n\n60(P + W) = 100\n100 / (P - W) = 100 / (P + W) + 40\n\nSolving this system of equations, we find:\n\nP = 50 mph\nW = 20 mph\n\nTherefore, the speed of the plane is 50 mph and the speed of the wind is 20 mph.\n\nThe answer is [50.0, 20.0]."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}, {"index": 16, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "the answer is {25.0, 75.0}"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}, {"index": 17, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "the answer is {25.0, 75.0}"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}, {"index": 18, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's assume the speed of the plane is P mph and the speed of the wind is W mph.\n\nOn the first trip, with the tailwind, the plane's effective speed is P + W mph.

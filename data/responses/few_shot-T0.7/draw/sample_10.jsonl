So, we can set up the equation:\n\n4/x + 9/y = 1/2\n\nTo solve this equation, we need another equation. We know that it takes 12 hours to fill the pool using both pipes. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n1/x + 1/y = 1/12\n\nNow, we have a system of equations:\n\n4/x + 9/y = 1/2\n1/x + 1/y = 1/12\n\nTo solve this system, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the method of substitution.\n\nFrom the second equation, we can solve for x in terms of y:\n\n1/x = 1/12 - 1/y\n1/x = (y - 12)/(12y)\nx = 12y/(y - 12)\n\nNow, substitute this value of x into the first equation:\n\n4/(12y/(y - 12)) + 9/y = 1/2\n4(y - 12)/(12y) + 9/y = 1/2\n(4y - 48)/(12y) + 9/y = 1/2\n(4y - 48 + 108)/(12y) = 1/2\n(4y + 60)/(12y) = 1/2\n\nCross multiply:\n\n2(4y + 60) = 12y\n8y + 120 = 12y\n120 = 4y\ny = 30\n\nNow, substitute this value of y back into the equation for x:\n\nx = 12(30)/(30 - 12)\nx = 360/18\nx = 20\n\nTherefore, the larger pipe can fill the pool in 20 hours and the smaller pipe can fill the pool in 30 hours.\n\nThe answer is [20, 30]."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 646, "completion_tokens": 9968, "total_tokens": 10614}, "question": "Question: It takes Sal 5 hours to paint a house .

The value of each quarter is $0.25, so the total value of quarters is 0.25q.\n2. The value of each dime is $0.10, so the total value of dimes is 0.10d.\n3. The total value of all the coins is $19.75, so 0.25q + 0.10d = 19.75.\n\nWe also know that the total number of coins is 100, so q + d = 100.\n\nTo solve these equations, we can use the substitution method or the elimination method. Let's use the elimination method:\n\nMultiply the first equation by 10 to eliminate the decimals:\n2.5q + d = 197.5\n\nNow, subtract the second equation from the first equation:\n2.5q + d - (q + d) = 197.5 - 100\n1.5q = 97.5\n\nDivide both sides of the equation by 1.5:\nq = 97.5 / 1.5\nq = 65\n\nNow substitute the value of q into the second equation:\n65 + d = 100\nd = 100 - 65\nd = 35\n\nTherefore, there are 35 dimes in the piggy bank.\n\nThe answer is [65, 35]."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}, {"index": 17, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's say the number of quarters is q and the number of dimes is d.\n\nFrom the given information, we can set up the following system of equations:\n0.25q + 0.10d = 19.75  (equation 1)\nq + d = 100  (equation 2)\n\nTo solve this system, we can use substitution or elimination method.\n\nLet's solve it using the elimination method. Multiply equation 2 by -0.10 to make the coefficients of d in both equations the same:\n-0.10(q + d) = -0.10(100)\n-0.10q - 0.10d = -10\n\nNow, add equation 1 and the modified equation 2:\n0.25q + 0.10d + (-0.10q - 0.10d) = 19.75 - 10\n0.25q - 0.10q + 0.10d - 0.10d = 9.75\n0.15q = 9.75\nq = 9.75 / 0.15\nq = 65\n\nSubstitute the value of q into equation 2 to find d:\n65 + d = 100\nd = 100 - 65\nd = 35\n\nTherefore, there are 35 dimes in the piggy bank.\nThe answer is [35]."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}, {"index": 18, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let x be the number of quarters and y be the number of dimes.\nBased on the given information, we can write two equations:\n1) x + y = 100 (equation 1)\n2) 0.25x + 0.10y = 19.75 (equation 2)\n\nTo solve these equations, we can use substitution or elimination method.

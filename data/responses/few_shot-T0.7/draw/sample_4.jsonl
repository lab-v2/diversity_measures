This means that the combined rate for those 13 hours is 1/2 of the pool.\n\nUsing the information above, we can set up the following equation:\n\n4/x + 9/y = 1/2\n\nTo solve this equation, we can multiply both sides by 2xy to eliminate the fractions:\n\n8y + 18x = xy\n\nNow, we need one more equation to solve for x and y.

Let's use the substitution method.\n\nFrom equation 1, we can express x in terms of y and z: x = 24 - y - z.\n\nSubstituting this value in equations 2 and 3, we get:\n\n10(24 - y - z) + 14y + 20z = 384\n0.95(24 - y - z) + 1.15y + 1.50z = 30.60\n\nSimplifying these equations, we have:\n\n240 - 10y - 10z + 14y + 20z = 384\n22.8 - 0.95y - 0.95z + 1.15y + 1.50z = 30.60\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n4y + 10z = 144\n0.2y + 0.55z = 7.8\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two variables. Let's solve this system.\n\nMultiplying the second equation by 20 to eliminate decimals, we have:\n\n4y + 10z = 144\n4y + 11z = 156\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:\n\nz = 12\n\nSubstituting this value back into the first equation, we have:\n\n4y + 10(12) = 144\n4y + 120 = 144\n4y = 24\ny = 6\n\nSubstituting the values of y and z back into the equation x = 24 - y - z, we have:\n\nx = 24 - 6 - 12\nx = 6\n\nTherefore, Kyle filled 6 cups of 10 oz, 6 cups of 14 oz, and 12 cups of 20 oz.\n\nThe answer is [6, 6, 12]."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}, {"index": 17, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "the answer is {8.0, 4.0, 12.0}"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}, {"index": 18, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "the answer is {6.0, 10.0, 8.0}"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}, {"index": 19, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "the answer is {8.0, 8.0, 8.0}"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 679, "completion_tokens": 4251, "total_tokens": 4930}, "question": "Question: One pan pizza and two cheesburgers provide 2860 calories .

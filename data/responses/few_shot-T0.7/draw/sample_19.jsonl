The distance is 350 feet and the time is 7 minutes, which is equal to 7/60 hours. So we have the equation:\n\n350 = (b + c) * (7/60)\n\nWe now have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve this system to find the values of b and c.\n\nMultiplying the first equation by 6 and the second equation by 60 to eliminate the fractions, we get:\n\n1800 = 6(b - c)\n\n2100 = 7(b + c)\n\nSimplifying these equations, we have:\n\n300 = b - c\n\n300 = 7b + 7c\n\nNow we can solve this system of equations. Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:\n\n0 = 6b + 8c\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we have:\n\n0 = 3b + 4c\n\nSolving this equation for b, we get:\n\nb = -4c/3\n\nSubstituting this value of b into the first equation, we have:\n\n300 = -4c/3 - c\n\nMultiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:\n\n900 = -4c - 3c\n\nCombining like terms, we have:\n\n900 = -7c\n\nDividing both sides by -7, we have:\n\nc = -900/-7\n\nc = 128.57 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nSubstituting this value of c back into the first equation, we have:\n\n300 = b - 128.57\n\nAdding 128.57 to both sides, we get:\n\nb = 428.57\n\nTherefore, the speed of the boat in still water is approximately 428.57 feet per hour and the speed of the current is approximately 128.57 feet per hour.\n\nthe answer is [428.57, 128.57]"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}, {"index": 4, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's assume the speed of the boat in still water is \"b\" and the speed of the current is \"c\".\n\nWhen the man rows upstream, his effective speed is reduced by the current, so his speed is (b - c).

In 7 minutes, he covers a distance of 350 feet, so we can write the equation:\n7(b + c) = 350\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two variables.

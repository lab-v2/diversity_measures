Therefore, we have the equation:\n\n300 = (x - y) * 10\n\nFor the downstream journey, the boat is rowing with the current, so the effective speed is (x + y) feet per minute. The distance traveled is 350 feet and the time taken is 7 minutes. Therefore, we have the equation:\n\n350 = (x + y) * 7\n\nNow we have a system of equations:\n\n300 = 10x - 10y\n350 = 7x + 7y\n\nWe can solve this system of equations to find the values of x and y.\n\nMultiplying the first equation by 7 and the second equation by 10, we get:\n\n2100 = 70x - 70y\n3500 = 70x + 70y\n\nAdding these two equations together, we eliminate the y terms:\n\n5600 = 140x\n\nDividing both sides by 140, we find:\n\nx = 40\n\nSubstituting this value back into the first equation, we can solve for y:\n\n300 = 10(40) - 10y\n300 = 400 - 10y\n10y = 400 - 300\n10y = 100\ny = 10\n\nSo, the speed of the boat is 40 feet per minute and the speed of the current is 10 feet per minute.\n\nTherefore, the answer is [40, 10]."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}, {"index": 6, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "the answer is {300.0, 350.0}"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}, {"index": 7, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "the answer is {250.0, 50.0}"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}, {"index": 8, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "the answer is {250.0, 50.0}"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}, {"index": 9, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "the answer is {60.0, 40.0}"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}, {"index": 10, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "the answer is {60.0, 40.0}"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}, {"index": 11, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "the answer is {60.0, 40.0}"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}, {"index": 12, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "the answer is {1000.0, 200.0}"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}, {"index": 13, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "the answer is {70.0, 30.0}"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}, {"index": 14, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "the answer is {150.0, 50.0}"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}, {"index": 15, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "the answer is {250.0, 50.0}"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}, {"index": 16, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "the answer is {250.0, 50.0}"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}, {"index": 17, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "the answer is {50.0, 5.0}"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}, {"index": 18, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "the answer is {250.0, 50.0}"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}, {"index": 19, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "the answer is {150.0, 50.0}"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 645, "completion_tokens": 629, "total_tokens": 1274}, "question": "Question: Desiree is twice as old as her cousin now .

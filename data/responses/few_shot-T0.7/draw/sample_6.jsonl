Let's let the speed of Bus A be represented by x mph and the speed of Bus B be represented by y mph.\n\nFrom the first scenario, we know that Bus A traveled for 10 hours and Bus B traveled for 10 hours minus the time it took for Bus A to overtake Bus B. Since the distance traveled by both buses is the same, we can set up the equation:\n\n10x = (10 - t)y, where t is the time it took for Bus A to overtake Bus B.\n\nFrom the second scenario, we know that the buses traveled toward each other for 2 hours. The total distance traveled by both buses is the sum of their individual distances:\n\n2(x + y) = 150\n\nNow we can solve this system of equations. First, let's solve the second equation for x+y:\n\nx + y = 75\n\nNow substitute this value into the first equation:\n\n10x = (10 - t)(75 - x)\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\n10x = 750 - 75t - 10x + tx\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n20x = 750 - 75t + tx\n\nNow, let's solve this equation for x:\n\n20x + 10x - tx = 750 - 75t\n\n30x - tx = 750 - 75t\n\nFactor out x:\n\nx(30 - t) = 750 - 75t\n\nDivide both sides by (30 - t):\n\nx = (750 - 75t)/(30 - t)\n\nSince we know that the speed of Bus A cannot be negative, we can ignore any solutions where (30 - t) is negative. Let's consider the case where (30 - t) is positive:\n\n30 - t > 0\nt < 30\n\nNow we can substitute this value of x back into the equation x + y = 75 to solve for y:\n\n(750 - 75t)/(30 - t) + y = 75\n\nMultiply both sides by (30 - t):\n\n750 - 75t + y(30 - t) = 75(30 - t)\n\nExpand and simplify:\n\n750 - 75t + 30y - yt = 2250 - 75t\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n30y - yt = 1500\n\nFactor out y:\n\ny(30 - t) = 1500\n\nDivide both sides by (30 - t):\n\ny = 1500/(30 - t)\n\nAgain, since the speed of Bus B cannot be negative, we can ignore any solutions where (30 - t) is negative. Let's consider the case where (30 - t) is positive:\n\n30 - t > 0\nt < 30\n\nSo the possible values for t are any positive number less than 30.
